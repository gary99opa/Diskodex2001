Phoenix 2001 Diskodex v1.01 Source Code Release from the O.P.A. 1989 Archive

Here is another great release, this program was first written by me and Cecil Chin back in 1989 with the manual written by my dad, and was one of my first commercially sold programs, under the "Phoenix 2001" label, which at the time meant that the useful of the software would at least last until year 2001, and in part was a nod to my love for the Space Odyssey, and my brand-new projects I am working on now in the year 2024 will soon be released under the "Phoenix 2061" label, keeping with the trend and usefulness of being valid to use on your TI-99/4a or emulators or future hardware until the year 2061 and for my love of classic Sci-Fi.

Enjoy! ðŸ¥³

DISKODEX 2001 makes up master catalogs of your disks, and allows you to print, update, delete, sort, and display any of your files/disks.

DISKODEX 2001 has the feature of storing file comments that DISK UTILITIES by John Birdwell uses, allowing better catalogs.

Even though it stores more information than other programs it runs faster, using every gram of TI power. You can search in any combination of prefixes, suffixes, and wildcards in any field combination. As it has easy-to-learn menus, you probably wonâ€™t need the comprehensive manual. These and other great features are contained in a cohesive 100% Assembly program fitting well within your 32K.

Itâ€™s amazing!! ðŸ™‚
